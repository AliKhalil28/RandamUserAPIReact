## Core React & JavaScript Concepts Used:
useState: Manages the state of users, current page, total pages, and loading status.
useEffect: Fetches the user data from the API and updates the state when the page changes.
Async/Await: Asynchronous JavaScript used for handling API requests and responses.
Conditional Rendering: Displays a loading indicator while data is being fetched.
Functional Components: The app is built with functional components for better readability and easier testing.
Props: Passing data between components, such as the list of users to UserCard and pagination controls to Pagination.
